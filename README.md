# Neural network-based video indexing service (study)

This repository contains all the work related my masters thesis
found here: https://www.theseus.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/780161/Pesu_Joel.pdf

## Jupyter notebooks

Jupyter notebooks include all of the data processing (COCO2017),
model training and validation, and some graphing and analysis.

## MappingService

In the directory of MappingService one can find the prototype docker
setup for a video indexing service. Note: paths may be hard-coded so replicating
its functionality might require some tinkering.
